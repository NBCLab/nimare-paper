  abstract = "Historically, the human frontal pole (FP) has been considered as
              a single architectonic area. Brodmann's area 10 is located in the
              frontal lobe with known contributions in the execution of various
              higher order cognitive processes. However, recent
              cytoarchitectural studies of the FP in humans have shown that
              this portion of cortex contains two distinct cytoarchitectonic
              regions. Since architectonic differences are accompanied by
              differential connectivity and functions, the frontal pole
              qualifies as a candidate region for exploratory parcellation into
              functionally discrete sub-regions. We investigated whether this
              functional heterogeneity is reflected in distinct segregations
              within cytoarchitectonically defined FP-areas using meta-analytic
              co-activation based parcellation (CBP). The CBP method examined
              the co-activation patterns of all voxels within the FP as
              reported in functional neuroimaging studies archived in the
              BrainMap database. Voxels within the FP were subsequently
              clustered into sub-regions based on the similarity of their
              respective meta-analytically derived co-activation maps.
              Performing this CBP analysis on the FP via k-means clustering
              produced a distinct 3-cluster parcellation for each hemisphere
              corresponding to previously identified cytoarchitectural
              differences. Post-hoc functional characterization of clusters via
              BrainMap metadata revealed that lateral regions of the FP mapped
              to memory and emotion domains, while the dorso- and ventromedial
              clusters were associated broadly with emotion and social
              cognition processes. Furthermore, the dorsomedial regions contain
              an emphasis on theory of mind and affective related paradigms
              whereas ventromedial regions couple with reward tasks. Results
              from this study support previous segregations of the FP and
              provide meta-analytic contributions to the ongoing discussion of
              elucidating functional architecture within human FP.",

              meta-analytic methods capable of identifying areas of consistent

              approach for combining published neuroimaging results from

              interstudy concordance while minimizing the subjective aspects of
              meta-analysis. In this method, a localization probability
              distribution was modeled for each activation focus obtained from
              11 PET studies of reading single words aloud, and the union of
              these distributions was taken to yield an activation likelihood
              estimate map for the brain. Significance was assessed via
              permutation analysis of randomly generated sets of foci. Regions
              of significant concordance were identified in bilateral motor and
              superior temporal cortices, pre-SMA, left fusiform gyrus, and the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Persistent pain is measured by means of self-report,
              the sole reliance on which hampers diagnosis and treatment.
              Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for
              identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that
              are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been
              identified. METHODS: In four studies involving a total of 114
              participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts
              pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1,
              we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI
              activity across brain regions--a neurologic signature--that was
              associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the
              thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary
              somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the
              periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we
              tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain
              versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed
              specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the
              same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the
              responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent
              remifentanil. RESULTS: In study 1, the neurologic signature
              showed sensitivity and specificity of 94\% or more (95\%
              confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful
              heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall.
              In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and
              nonpainful warmth with 93\% sensitivity and specificity (95\% CI,
              84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain
              and social pain with 85\% sensitivity (95\% CI, 76 to 94) and
              73\% specificity (95\% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95\% sensitivity
              and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two
              conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the
              signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil
              was administered. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use fMRI to
              assess pain elicited by noxious heat in healthy persons. Future
              studies are needed to assess whether the signature predicts
              clinical pain. (Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse

              behavioral meta-data of the retrieved experiments. Task-dependent
              functional connectivity was characterized by meta-analytic
              connectivity modeling (MACM) of significant co-activations with
              these seed regions. Task-independent resting-state functional
              connectivity analysis in a sample of 100 healthy subjects
              complemented these analyses. All three seed regions co-activated
              with subgenual cingulum (SGC), precuneus (PCu) and nucleus
              accumbens (NAcc) in the task-dependent MACM analysis.
              Task-independent resting-state connectivity revealed significant
              coupling of the seeds only with the SGC, but not the PCu and the
              NAcc. The former region (SGC) moreover was shown to feature
              significant resting-state connectivity with all other regions
              implicated in the network connected to regions where emotional
              processing may be modulated by a cognitive distractor. Based on
              its functional profile and connectivity pattern, we suggest that
              the SGC might serve as a key hub in the identified network, as
              such linking autobiographic information [PCu], reward [NAcc],
              (reinforce) values [OFC] and emotional significance [AMY]. Such a
              role, in turn, may allow the SGC to influence the OFC and AMY to
              modulate affective processing.",

              has recently been suggested that PHC engagement during functional
              MRI simply reflects the representation of three-dimensional local
              space. If so, PHC should respond to space in the absence of
              scenes, geometric layout, objects or contextual associations. It
              has also been reported that PHC activation may be influenced by
              low-level visual properties of stimuli such as spatial frequency.
              Here, we tested whether PHC was responsive to the mere sense of
              space in highly simplified stimuli, and whether this was affected
              by their spatial frequency distribution. Participants were
              scanned using functional MRI while viewing depictions of simple
              three-dimensional space, and matched control stimuli that did not
              depict a space. Half the stimuli were low-pass filtered to
              ascertain the impact of spatial frequency. We observed a
              significant interaction between space and spatial frequency in
              bilateral PHC. Specifically, stimuli depicting space (more than
              nonspatial stimuli) engaged the right PHC when they featured high
              spatial frequencies. In contrast, the interaction in the left PHC
              did not show a preferential response to space. We conclude that a
              simple depiction of three-dimensional space that is devoid of
              objects, scene layouts or contextual associations is sufficient
              to robustly engage the right PHC, at least when high spatial
              frequencies are present. We suggest that coding for the presence
              of space may be a core function of PHC, and could explain its
              engagement in a range of tasks, including scene processing, where
              space is always present.",

              subserving the manipulation of this information. Recent
              meta-analytic findings have identified the anterior lateral
              prefrontal cortex, in particular, as being generally engaged by
              working memory tasks, while the posterior lateral prefrontal
              cortex was more strongly associated with the cognitive load
              required by these tasks. These findings suggest specific roles
              for these regions in the cognitive control processes underlying
              working memory. To further characterize these regions, we applied
              three distinct seed-based methods for determining cortical
              connectivity. Specifically, we employed meta-analytic
              connectivity mapping across task-based fMRI experiments,
              resting-state BOLD correlations, and VBM-based structural
              covariance. We found a frontoparietal pattern of convergence
              which strongly resembled the working memory networks identified
              in previous research. A contrast between anterior and posterior
              parts of the lateral prefrontal cortex revealed distinct
              connectivity patterns consistent with the idea of a hierarchical
              organization of frontoparietal networks. Moreover, we found a
              distributed network that was anticorrelated with the anterior
              seed region, which included most of the default mode network and
              a subcomponent related to social and emotional processing. These
              findings fit well with the internal attention model of working
              memory, in which representation of information is processed
              according to an anteroposterior gradient of abstract-to-concrete

              Specifically, we performed hierarchical clustering on the modeled

              mapping of LFC from 11 406 neuroimaging studies. We identified

              avenues to further optimize ALE. First, we demonstrate that the

              related to the number of foci it reports and their proximity. We
              present a modified ALE algorithm that eliminates these
              within-experiment effects. However, we show that these effects
              only account for 2-3\% of cumulative ALE values, and removing
              them has little impact on thresholded ALE maps. Next, we present
              an alternate organizational approach to datasets that prevents
              subject groups with multiple experiments in a dataset from
              influencing ALE values more than others. This modification
              decreases cumulative ALE values by 7-9\%, changes the relative
              magnitude of some clusters, and reduces cluster extents. Overall,

              fewer subjects. Interest in meta-analysis in brain mapping is
              also driven by a recent focus on so-called ``reverse inference'':
              where as traditional ``forward inference'' identifies the regions
              of the brain involved in a task, a reverse inference identifies
              the cognitive processes that a task engages. Such reverse
              inferences, however, requires a set of meta-analysis, one for
              each possible cognitive domain. However, existing methods for
              neuroimaging meta-analysis have significant limitations. Commonly
              used methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis are not model based,
              do not provide interpretable parameter estimates, and only
              produce null hypothesis inferences; further, they are generally
              designed for a single group of studies and cannot produce reverse
              inferences. In this work we address these limitations by adopting
              a non-parametric Bayesian approach for meta analysis data from
              multiple classes or types of studies. In particular, foci from
              each type of study are modeled as a cluster process driven by a
              random intensity function that is modeled as a kernel convolution
              of a gamma random field. The type-specific gamma random fields
              are linked and modeled as a realization of a common gamma random
              field, shared by all types, that induces correlation between
              study types and mimics the behavior of a univariate mixed effects
              model. We illustrate our model on simulation studies and a meta
              analysis of five emotions from 219 studies and check model fit by
              a posterior predictive assessment. In addition, we implement
              reverse inference by using the model to predict study type from a
              newly presented study. We evaluate this predictive performance

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: The functional organization of human medial frontal
              cortex (MFC) is a subject of intense study. Using fMRI, the MFC
              has been associated with diverse psychological processes,
              including motor function, cognitive control, affect, and social
              cognition. However, there have been few large-scale efforts to
              comprehensively map specific psychological functions to
              subregions of medial frontal anatomy. Here we applied a
              meta-analytic data-driven approach to nearly 10,000 fMRI studies
              to identify putatively separable regions of MFC and determine
              which psychological states preferentially recruit their
              activation. We identified regions at several spatial scales on
              the basis of meta-analytic coactivation, revealing three broad
              functional zones along a rostrocaudal axis composed of 2-4
              smaller subregions each. Multivariate classification analyses
              aimed at identifying the psychological functions most strongly
              predictive of activity in each region revealed a tripartite
              division within MFC, with each zone displaying a relatively
              distinct functional signature. The posterior zone was associated
              preferentially with motor function, the middle zone with
              cognitive control, pain, and affect, and the anterior with
              reward, social processing, and episodic memory. Within each zone,
              the more fine-grained subregions showed distinct, but subtler,
              variations in psychological function. These results provide
              hypotheses about the functional organization of medial prefrontal
              cortex that can be tested explicitly in future studies.
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Activation of medial frontal cortex in
              fMRI studies is associated with a wide range of psychological
              states ranging from cognitive control to pain. However, this high
              rate of activation makes it challenging to determine how these
              various processes are topologically organized across medial
              frontal anatomy. We conducted a meta-analysis across nearly
              10,000 studies to comprehensively map psychological states to
              discrete subregions in medial frontal cortex using relatively
              unbiased data-driven methods. This approach revealed three
              distinct zones that differed substantially in function, each of
              which were further subdivided into 2-4 smaller subregions that
              showed additional functional variation. Each individual region
              was recruited by multiple psychological states, suggesting
              subregions of medial frontal cortex are functionally
              heterogeneous.",

              First, we evaluate the feasibility of two techniques for
              correcting for multiple comparisons: the single threshold test
              and a procedure that controls the false discovery rate (FDR). To
              test these techniques, foci from four different topics within the
              literature were analyzed: overt speech in stuttering subjects,
              the color-word Stroop task, picture-naming tasks, and painful
              stimulation. In addition, the performance of each thresholding
              method was tested on randomly generated foci. We found that the
              FDR method more effectively controls the rate of false positives
              in meta-analyses of small or large numbers of foci. Second, we
              propose a technique for making statistical comparisons of ALE
              meta-analyses and investigate its efficacy on different groups of
              foci divided by task or response type and random groups of

              on reward processing that synthesizes findings across the

              we used emerging meta-analytic techniques to elucidate brain
              regions, and in turn networks, consistently engaged in distinct
              aspects of reward processing. Using a data-driven, meta-analytic,

              identified a seven-MAG clustering solution that represented

              only the sample means in two treatment arms and the sample sizes,
              but no sample standard deviation. The statistical comparison
              between two arms for this case is not possible within the

              behavior, knowledge of its subspecialization is primarily derived
              from experiments in animals. We here employed methods for
              large-scale data mining to perform a connectivity-derived
              parcellation of the human amygdala based on whole-brain
              coactivation patterns computed for each seed voxel. Voxels within
              the histologically defined human amygdala were clustered into
              distinct groups based on their brain-wide coactivation maps.
              Using this approach, connectivity-based parcellation divided the
              amygdala into three distinct clusters that are highly consistent
              with earlier microstructural distinctions. Meta-analytic
              connectivity modelling then revealed the derived clusters'
              brain-wide connectivity patterns, while meta-data profiling
              allowed their functional characterization. These analyses
              revealed that the amygdala's laterobasal nuclei group was
              associated with coordinating high-level sensory input, whereas
              its centromedial nuclei group was linked to mediating
              attentional, vegetative, and motor responses. The often-neglected
              superficial nuclei group emerged as particularly sensitive to
              olfactory and probably social information processing. The results

              function in the brain, it must assemble maps for many different
              cognitive processes, which often evoke overlapping patterns of
              activation. Such data aggregation faces contrasting goals: on the
              one hand finding correspondences across vastly different

              describing the function of any given brain region. Here we

              experimental conditions. Unlike conventional brain mapping, this

              the mental processes from brain activity in the regions
              delineated by the atlas. To establish that this reverse inference
              is indeed governed by the corresponding concepts, and not
              idiosyncrasies of experimental designs, we show that it can
              accurately decode the cognitive concepts recruited in new tasks.
              These results demonstrate that aggregating independent task-fMRI

              (Caspers et al., Brain Structure \& Function, 2013). To gain a

              their behavioral involvement and coactivation patterns by means
              of meta-analytic connectivity modeling based on the BrainMap

              certain behavioral tasks by name (e.g., the Stroop paradigm or
              the Sternberg paradigm) or by function (a working memory task, a
              visual attention task), these paradigms can vary tremendously in
              the stimuli that are presented to the subject, the response
              expected from the subject, and the instructions given to the
              subject. Drawing from the taxonomy developed and used by the
              BrainMap project ( www.brainmap.org ) for almost two decades to
              describe key components of published functional imaging results,
              we have developed an ontology capable of representing certain
              characteristics of the cognitive paradigms used in the fMRI and
              PET literature. The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology is being
              developed to be compliant with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO),

              RadLex, NeuroLex, or the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations

              experimental conditions focused on the stimuli presented, the
              instructions given, and the responses requested. The use of
              alternate and even competitive terminologies can often impede

              stimulus, response, and instruction has been shown to allow

              probability distributions whose width is based on empirical
              estimates of the spatial uncertainty due to the between-subject
              and between-template variability of neuroimaging data. ALE
              results are assessed against a null-distribution of random
              spatial association between experiments, resulting in
              random-effects inference. In the present revision of this

              algorithm. First, the assessment of spatial association between
              experiments was based on a highly time-consuming permutation
              test, which nevertheless entailed the danger of underestimating
              the right tail of the null-distribution. In this report, we
              outline how this previous approach may be replaced by a faster
              and more precise analytical method. Second, the previously
              applied correction procedure, i.e. controlling the false
              discovery rate (FDR), is supplemented by new approaches for
              correcting the family-wise error rate and the cluster-level
              significance. The different alternatives for drawing inference on
              meta-analytic results are evaluated on an exemplary dataset on
              face perception as well as discussed with respect to their
              methodological limitations and advantages. In summary, we thus
              replaced the previous permutation algorithm with a faster and
              more rigorous analytical solution for the null-distribution and
              comprehensively address the issue of multiple-comparison
              corrections. The proposed revision of the ALE-algorithm should

              increasing interest in meta analysis of brain imaging studies. A
              typical neuroimaging meta analysis collects peak activation
              coordinates (foci) from several studies and identifies areas of
              consistent activation. Most imaging meta analysis methods only
              produce null hypothesis inferences and do not provide an
              interpretable fitted model. To overcome these limitations, we
              propose a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model using a marked
              independent cluster process. We model the foci as offspring of a
              latent study center process, and the study centers are in turn
              offspring of a latent population center process. The posterior
              intensity function of the population center process provides
              inference on the location of population centers, as well as the
              inter-study variability of foci about the population centers. We
              illustrate our model with a meta analysis consisting of 437
              studies from 164 publications, show how two subpopulations of
              studies can be compared and assess our model via sensitivity
              analyses and simulation studies. Supplemental materials are

              activation coordinates (foci) reported in the article are
              available for Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis (CBMA). Neuroimaging
              meta-analysis is used to (i) identify areas of consistent

              neural correlates of face processing enrolling a total of 164 ASD

              brain regions involved in human action observation/imitation. We

              However, DMN regions have also been reported as task-related
              increases, either independently or coactivated with other regions

              The co-activation pattern of a given region can be investigated
              using seed-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis
              of functional neuroimaging data stored in databases such as

              connectivity by determining brain regions that are consistently
              co-activated with a given region of interest (the ``seed'')
              across a broad range of experiments. In current implementations
              of this meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), significant
              spatial convergence (i.e. consistent co-activation) is
              distinguished from noise by comparing it against an unbiased
              null-distribution of random spatial associations between
              experiments according to which all gray-matter voxels have the
              same chance of convergence. As the a priori probability of
              finding activation in different voxels markedly differs across
              the brain, computing such a quasi-rectangular null-distribution
              renders the detection of significant convergence more likely in
              those voxels that are frequently activated. Here, we propose and
              test a modified MACM approach that takes this activation
              frequency bias into account. In this new specific co-activation

              generated that reflects the base rate of reporting activation in
              any given voxel and thus equalizes the a priori chance of finding
              across-study convergence in each voxel of the brain. Using four
              exemplary seed regions (right visual area V4, left anterior
              insula, right intraparietal sulcus, and subgenual cingulum), our
              tests corroborated the enhanced specificity of the modified
              algorithm, indicating that SCALE may be especially useful for
              delineating distinct core networks of co-activation.",

              findings have been limited by the insula's remarkably high base
              rate of activation and considerable functional heterogeneity. The
              present study used a relatively unbiased data-driven approach
              combining resting-state connectivity-based parcellation of the
              insula with large-scale meta-analysis to understand how the

              areas [operculum parietale (OP) 1 and OP 4] within this region
              particularly pertain to their connection with either the
              perceptive parietal network or the frontal motor areas. In the

              connection patterns probed by probabilistic tractography on
              diffusion tensor imaging data. Functional connectivity was then
              mapped by coordinate-based meta-analysis of imaging studies.
              Comparison between these two aspects of connectivity showed a
              good congruency and hence converging evidence for an involvement
              of these areas in matching brain networks. There were, however,
              also several instances in which anatomical and functional
              connectivity diverged, underlining the independence of these
              measures and the need for multimodal characterization of brain
              connectivity. The connectivity analyses performed showed that the
              two largest areas within the human parietal operculum region
              display considerable differences in their connectivity to
              frontoparietal brain regions. In particular, relative to OP 1,

              basic sensorimotor processing and action control, while OP 1 is
              more closely connected to the parietal networks for higher order
              somatosensory processing. These results are largely congruent

              commonly used to make inferences about ``functional

              morphometric measures, such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) or

              meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), VBM correlations, and

              depended on the threshold applied to the connectivity

  abstract = "Lagging behind rapid changes to state laws, societal views, and
              medical practice is the scientific investigation of cannabis’s
              impact on the human brain. While several brain imaging studies
              have contributed important insight into neurobiological
              alterations linked with cannabis use, our understanding remains
              limited. Here, we sought to delineate those brain regions that
              consistently demonstrate functional alterations among cannabis
              users versus non-users across neuroimaging studies using the
              activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis framework.
              In ancillary analyses, we characterized task-related brain
              networks that co-activate with cannabis-affected regions using
              data archived in a large neuroimaging repository, and then
              determined which psychological processes may be disrupted via
              functional decoding techniques. When considering convergent
              alterations among users, decreased activation was observed in
              the anterior cingulate cortex, which co-activated with frontal,
              parietal, and limbic areas and was linked with cognitive control
              processes. Similarly, decreased activation was observed in the
              dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which co-activated with frontal
              and occipital areas and linked with attention-related processes.
              Conversely, increased activation among users was observed in the
              striatum, which co-activated with frontal, parietal, and other
              limbic areas and linked with reward processing. These
              meta-analytic outcomes indicate that cannabis use is linked with
              differential, region-specific effects across the brain."

  abstract = {A widely used technique for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data is activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which determines the convergence of foci reported from different experiments. ALE analysis involves modelling these foci as probability distributions whose width is based on empirical estimates of the spatial uncertainty due to the between-subject and between-template variability of neuroimaging data. ALE results are assessed against a null-distribution of random spatial association between experiments, resulting in random-effects inference. In the present revision of this algorithm, we address two remaining drawbacks of the previous algorithm. First, the assessment of spatial association between experiments was based on a highly time-consuming permutation test, which nevertheless entailed the danger of underestimating the right tail of the null-distribution. In this report, we outline how this previous approach may be replaced by a faster and more precise analytical method. Second, the previously applied correction procedure, i.e. controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), is supplemented by new approaches for correcting the family-wise error rate and the cluster-level significance. The different alternatives for drawing inference on meta-analytic results are evaluated on an exemplary dataset on face perception as well as discussed with respect to their methodological limitations and advantages. In summary, we thus replaced the previous permutation algorithm with a faster and more rigorous analytical solution for the null-distribution and comprehensively address the issue of multiple-comparison corrections. The proposed revision of the ALE-algorithm should provide an improved tool for conducting coordinate-based meta-analyses on functional imaging data.}
