<p>As mentioned in the discussion of BrainMap (<a class="reference internal" href="resources.html#content-resources-brainmap"><span class="std std-ref">BrainMap</span></a>), manually annotating studies in a meta-analytic database can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process.
To facilitate more efficient (albeit lower-quality) annotation, NiMARE supports a number of automated annotation approaches.
These include n-gram term extraction, Cognitive Atlas term extraction, latent Dirichlet allocation, and generalized correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation.</p>
<p>NiMARE users may download abstracts from PubMed as long as study identifiers in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dataset</span></code> correspond to PubMed IDs (as in Neurosynth and NeuroQuery).
Abstracts are much more easily accessible than full article text, so most annotation methods in NiMARE rely on them.</p>
<p>Below, we use the function <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nimare.extract.download_abstracts()</span></code> to download abstracts for the Neurosynth <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dataset</span></code>.
This will attempt to extract metadata about each study in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dataset</span></code> from PubMed, and then add the abstract available on Pubmed to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dataset</span></code>’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">texts</span></code> attribute, under a new column names “abstract”.</p>

<h2>N-gram term extraction<a class="headerlink" href="#n-gram-term-extraction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>N-gram term extraction</strong> refers to the vectorization of text into contiguous sets of words that can be counted as individual tokens.
The upper limit on the number of words in these tokens is set by the user.</p>
<p>NiMARE has the function <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nimare.annotate.text.generate_counts()</span></code> to extract n-grams from text.
This method produces either term counts or term frequency- inverse document frequency (tf-idf) values for each of the studies in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dataset</span></code>.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive Atlas term extraction</strong> leverages the structured nature of the Cognitive Atlas in order to extract counts for individual terms and their synonyms in the ontology, as well as to apply hierarchical expansion to these counts based on the relationships specified between terms.
This method produces both basic term counts and expanded term counts based on the weights applied to different relationship types present in the ontology.</p>
<p>First, we must use <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nimare.extract.download_cognitive_atlas()</span></code> to download the current version of the Cognitive Atlas ontology.
This includes both information about individual terms in the ontology and asserted relationships between those terms.</p>
<p>NiMARE will automatically attempt to extrapolate likely alternate forms of each term in the ontology, in order to make extraction easier.
For an example, see <a class="reference internal" href="#tbl-table-cogat-forms"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 11</span></a>.</p>

<h2>Latent Dirichlet allocation<a class="headerlink" href="#latent-dirichlet-allocation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Latent Dirichlet allocation</strong> (LDA) <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id28">Blei <em>et al.</em>, 2003</a>]</span> was originally combined with meta-analytic neuroimaging data in <span id="id2">Poldrack <em>et al.</em> [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id4">2012</a>]</span>.
LDA is a generative topic model which, for a text corpus, builds probability distributions across documents and words.
In LDA, each document is considered a mixture of topics.
This works under the assumption that each document was constructed by first randomly selecting a topic based on the document’s probability distribution across topics, and then randomly selecting a word from that topic based on the topic’s probability distribution across words.
While this is not a useful generative model for producing documents, LDA is able to discern cohesive topics of related words.
<span id="id3">Poldrack <em>et al.</em> [<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id4">2012</a>]</span> were able to apply LDA to full texts from neuroimaging articles in order to develop cognitive neuroscience-related topics and to run topic-wise meta-analyses.
This method produces two sets of probability distributions: (1) the probability of a word given topic and (2) the probability of a topic given article.</p>
<p>NiMARE uses a Python-based interface to the MALLET Java library <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id96">McCallum, 2002</a>]</span> to implement LDA.
NiMARE will download MALLET automatically, when necessary.</p>
<p>Here, we train an LDA model (<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nimare.annotate.lda.LDAModel</span></code>) on the first 500 studies of the Neurosynth <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dataset</span></code>, with 100 topics in the model.</p>

<p>The most important products of training the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LDAModel</span></code> object are its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p_word_g_topic_df_</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p_topic_g_doc_df_</span></code> attributes.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p_word_g_topic_df_</span></code> attribute is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas</span></code> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame</span></code> in which each row corresponds to a topic and each column corresponds to a term (n-gram) extracted from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dataset</span></code>’s texts.
The cells contain weights indicating the probability of selecting the term given that the topic was already selected.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p_topic_g_doc_df_</span></code> attribute is also a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame</span></code>.
In this one, each row corresponds to a study in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dataset</span></code> and each column is a topic.
The cell values indicate the probability of selecting a topic when contructing the given study.
Practically, this indicates the relative proportion with which the topic describes that study.</p>
<p>First, we will reorganize the DataFrame a bit to show the top ten terms for each topic.</p>

<h2>Generalized correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation<a class="headerlink" href="#generalized-correspondence-latent-dirichlet-allocation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Generalized correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation</strong> (GCLDA) is a recently-developed algorithm that trains topics on both article abstracts and coordinates <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id83">Rubin <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>]</span>.
GCLDA assumes that topics within the fMRI literature can also be localized to brain regions, in this case modeled as three-dimensional Gaussian distributions.
These spatial distributions can also be restricted to pairs of Gaussians that are symmetric across brain hemispheres.
This method produces two sets of probability distributions: the probability of a word given topic (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GCLDAModel.p_word_g_topic_</span></code>) and the probability of a voxel given topic (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GCLDAModel.p_voxel_g_topic_</span></code>).</p>
<p>Here we train a GCLDA model (<code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nimare.annotate.gclda.GCLDAModel</span></code>) on the first 500 studies of the Neurosynth Dataset.
The model will include 100 topics, in which the spatial distribution for each topic will be defined as having two Gaussian distributions that are symmetrically localized across the longitudinal fissure.</p>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GCLDAModel</span></code> retains the relevant probability distributions in the form of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code> arrays, rather than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas</span></code> DataFrames.
However, for the topic-term weights (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p_word_g_topic_</span></code>), the data are more interpretable as a DataFrame, so we will create one.
We will also reorganize the raw DataFrame to show the top ten terms for each topic.</p>
