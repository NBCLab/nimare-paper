Module	Description
`dataset`	This module stores the `Dataset` class, which contains NiMARE datasets.
`meta`	This module contains `Estimators` for image- and coordinate-based meta-analysis algorithms, as well as `KernelTransformers`, which are used in conjunction with coordinate-based methods.
`results`	This module stores the `MetaResult` class, which in turn is used to manage statistical maps produced by meta-analytic algorithms.
`correct`	This module contains classes for multiple comparisons correction, including `FWECorrector` (family-wise error rate correction) and `FDRCorrector` (false discovery rate correction).
`annotate`	This module includes a range of tools for automated annotation of studies. Methods in this module include: topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation and generalized correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation; ontology-based annotation, such as Cognitive Atlas term extract from text; and general text-based feature extraction, such as count or tf-idf extraction from text.
`decode`	This module includes a number of methods for functional characterization analysis, also known as functional decoding. Methods in this module are divided into three groups: discrete, for decoding regions of interest or subsets of the Dataset; continuous, for decoding unthresholded statistical maps; and encoding, for simulating statistical maps from labels.
`io`	This module contains functions for converting common file types, such as Neurosynth- or Sleuth-format files, into NiMARE-compatible formats, such as `Dataset` objects.
`transforms`	This module contains classes and functions for converting between common data types. Two important classes in this module are the `ImageTransformer`, which uses available images and metadata to produce new images in a Dataset, and the `ImagesToCoordinates`, which extracts peak coordinates from images in the Dataset, so that image-based studies can be used for coordinate-based meta-analyses.
`extract`	This module contains functions for downloading external resources, such as the Neurosynth dataset and the Cognitive Atlas ontology.
`stats`	This module contains miscellaneous statistical methods used throughout the rest of the library.
`generate`	This module contains functions for generating useful data for internal testing and validation.
`utils`	This module contains miscellaneous utility functions used throughout the rest of the library.
`workflows`	This module contains a number of common workflows that can be run from the command line, such as an ALE meta-analysis or a contrast-permutation image-based meta-analysis. All of the workflow functions additionally generate boilerplate text that can be included in manuscript methods sections.
`base`	This module defines a number of base classes used throughout the rest of the library.
