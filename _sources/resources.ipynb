    "These databases combine results from neuroimaging studies, whether represented as coordinates of peak activations or unthresholded statistical images, with important study metadata, such as information about the samples acquired, stimuli used, analyses performed, and mental constructs putatively manipulated.\n",
    "The two most popular coordinate-based meta-analytic databases are [BrainMap](http://www.brainmap.org) and [Neurosynth](http://neurosynth.org), while the most popular image-based database is [NeuroVault](https://neurovault.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "The studies archived in these databases may be either manually or automatically annotatedâ€”often with reference to a formal ontology or controlled vocabulary.\n",
    "Ontologies for cognitive neuroscience define what mental states or processes are postulated to be manipulated or measured in experiments, and may also include details of said experiments (e.g.,the cognitive tasks employed), relationships between concepts (e.g., verbal working memory is a kind of working memory), and various other metadata that can be standardized and represented in a machine-readable form {cite:p}`Poldrack2016-ym,Poldrack2010-jz,Turner2012-ai`.\n",
    "Some of these ontologies are very well-defined, such as expert-generated taxonomies designed specifically to describe only certain aspects of experiments and the relationships between elements within the taxonomy, while others are more loosely defined, in some cases simply building a vocabulary based on which terms are commonly used in cognitive neuroscience articles."

    "First, Neurosynth is unable to delineate individual comparisons within studies, and consequently uses the entire paper as its unit of measurement, unlike BrainMap.\n",
    "This risks conflating directly contrasted comparisons (e.g., A>B and B>A), as well as comparisons which have no relation to one another.\n",
