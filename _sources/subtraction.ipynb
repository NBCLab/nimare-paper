    "Subtraction analysis refers to the voxel-wise comparison of two meta-analytic samples.\n",
    "In image-based meta-analysis, comparisons between groups of maps can generally be accomplished within the standard meta-regression framework (i.e., by adding a covariate that codes for group membership).\n",
    "However, coordinate-based subtraction analysis requires special extensions for CBMA algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtraction analysis to compare the results of two ALE meta-analyses was originally implemented by {cite:t}`Laird2005-qh` and later extended by {cite:t}`Eickhoff2012-hk`.\n",
    "In this approach, two groups of experiments (A and B) are compared using a group assignment randomization procedure in which voxel-wise null distributions are generated by randomly reassigning experiments between the two groups and calculating ALE-difference scores for each permutation.\n",
    "Real ALE-difference scores (i.e., the ALE values for one group minus the ALE values for the other) are compared against these null distributions to determine voxel-wise significance.\n",
    "In the original implementation of the algorithm, this procedure is performed separately for a group A > B contrast and a group B > A contrast, where each contrast is limited to voxels that were significant in the first group's original meta-analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NiMARE, we use an adapted version of the subtraction analysis method in {py:class}`nimare.meta.cbma.ale.ALESubtraction`.\n",
    "Note that, unlike the original algorithm, the NiMARE implementation analyzes all voxels, rather than only those that show a significant effect of A alone or B alone."
