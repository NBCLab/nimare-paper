# NiMARE Overview

NiMARE is designed to be modular and object-oriented, with an interface that mimics popular Python libraries, including scikit-learn and nilearn.
This standardized interface allows users to employ a wide range of meta-analytic algorithms without having to familiarize themselves with the idiosyncrasies of algorithm-specific tools.
This lets users use whatever method is most appropriate for a given research question with minimal mental overhead from switching methods.
Additionally, NiMARE emphasizes citability, with references in the documentation and citable boilerplate text that can be copied directly into manuscripts, in order to ensure that the original algorithm developers are appropriately recognized.

NiMARE works with Python versions 3.6 and higher, and can easily be installed with `pip`.
Its source code is housed and version controlled in a GitHub repository at https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE.

NiMARE is under continued active development, and we anticipate that the user-facing API (application programming interface) may change over time.
Our emphasis in this paper is thus primarily on reviewing the functionality implemented in the package and illustrating the general interface, and not on providing a detailed and static user guide that will be found within the package documentation.

Tools in NiMARE are organized into several modules, including {py:mod}`nimare.meta`, {py:mod}`nimare.correct`, {py:mod}`nimare.annotate`, {py:mod}`nimare.decode`, and {py:mod}`nimare.workflows`.
In addition to these primary modules, there are several secondary modules for data wrangling and internal helper functions, including {py:mod}`nimare.io`, {py:mod}`nimare.dataset`, {py:mod}`nimare.extract`, {py:mod}`nimare.stats`, {py:mod}`nimare.utils`, and {py:mod}`nimare.base`.
These modules are summarized in [](overview:api), as well as in {numref}`table_modules`.

## Application Programming Interface

One of the principal goals of NiMARE is to implement a range of methods with a set of shared interfaces, to enable users to employ the most appropriate algorithm for a given question without introducing a steep learning curve.
This approach is modeled on the widely-used `scikit-learn` package {cite:p}`scikit-learn,sklearn_api`, which implements a large number of machine learning algorithms - all with simple, consistent interfaces.
Regardless of the algorithm employed, data should be in the same format and the same class methods should be called to fit and/or generate predictions from the model.

To this end, we have adopted an object-oriented approach to NiMAREâ€™s core API that organizes tools based on the type of inputs and outputs they operate over.
The key data structure is the {py:class}`~nimare.dataset.Dataset` class, which stores a range of neuroimaging data amenable to various forms of meta-analysis.
There are two main types of tools that operate on a `Dataset` class.
{py:class}`~nimare.base.Transformer` classes, as their name suggests, perform some transformation on a `Dataset`- i.e., they take a `Dataset` instance as input, and return a modified version of that `Dataset` instance as output (for example, with newly generated maps stored within the object).
{py:class}`~nimare.base.Estimator` classes apply a meta-analytic algorithm to a `Dataset` and return a set of statistical images stored in a MetaResult container class.
The key methods supported by each of these base classes, as well as the main arguments to those methods, are consistent throughout the hierarchy (e.g., all `Transformer` classes must implement a `transform()` method), minimizing the learning curve and ensuring a high degree of predictability for users.

## Package Organization

At present, the package is organized into 14 distinct modules.
{py:mod}`nimare.dataset` defines the `Dataset` class.
{py:mod}`nimare.meta` includes `Estimators` for coordinate- and image-based meta-analysis methods.
{py:mod}`nimare.results` defines the `MetaResult` class, which stores statistical maps produced by meta-analyses.
{py:mod}`nimare.correct` implements `Corrector` classes for family-wise error (FWE) and false discovery rate (FDR) multiple comparisons correction.
{py:mod}`nimare.annotate` implements a range of automated annotation methods, including latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and generalized correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation (GCLDA).
{py:mod}`nimare.decode` implements a number of meta-analytic functional decoding and encoding algorithms.
{py:mod}`nimare.io` provides functions for converting alternative meta-analytic dataset structure, such as Sleuth text files or Neurosynth datasets, to NiMARE format.
{py:mod}`nimare.transforms` implements a range of spatial and data type transformations, including a function to generate new images in the `Dataset` from existing image types.
{py:mod}`nimare.extract` provides methods for fetching datasets and models across the internet.
{py:mod}`nimare.generate` includes functions for generating data for internal testing and validation.
{py:mod}`nimare.base` defines a number of base classes used throughout the rest of the package.
Finally, {py:mod}`nimare.stats` and {py:mod}`nimare.utils` are modules for statistical and generic utility functions, respectively.
These modules are summarized in {numref}`table_modules`.

Methods in this module are divided into three groups: discrete, for decoding regions of interest or subsets of the Dataset; continuous, for decoding unthresholded statistical maps; and encoding, for simulating statistical maps from labels.                                     |

| `transforms` | This module contains classes and functions for converting between common data types. Two important classes in this module are the `ImageTransformer`, which uses available images and metadata to produce new images in a Dataset, and the `ImagesToCoordinates`, which extracts peak coordinates from images in the Dataset, so that image-based studies can be used for coordinate-based meta-analyses. |

| `workflows`  | This module contains a number of common workflows that can be run from the command line, such as an ALE meta-analysis or a contrast-permutation image-based meta-analysis. All of the workflow functions additionally generate boilerplate text that can be included in manuscript methods sections.                                                                                                      |
