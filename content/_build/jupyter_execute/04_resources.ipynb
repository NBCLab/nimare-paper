    "First, Neurosynth is unable to delineate individual comparisons within studies, and consequently uses the entire paper as its unit of measurement, unlike BrainMap.\n",

    "Nevertheless, while individual meta-analyses should not be published from Neurosynth, many derivative analyses have been performed and published (e.g., {cite:p}`Chang2013-si,De_la_Vega2016-wg,De_la_Vega2018-jc,Poldrack2012-it`).\n",
