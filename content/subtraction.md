Subtraction analysis refers to the voxel-wise comparison of two meta-analytic samples.
In image-based meta-analysis, comparisons between groups of maps can generally be accomplished within the standard meta-regression framework (i.e., by adding a covariate that codes for group membership).
However, coordinate-based subtraction analysis requires special extensions for CBMA algorithms.

Subtraction analysis to compare the results of two ALE meta-analyses was originally implemented by {cite:t}`Laird2005-qh` and later extended by {cite:t}`Eickhoff2012-hk`.
In this approach, two groups of experiments (A and B) are compared using a group assignment randomization procedure in which voxel-wise null distributions are generated by randomly reassigning experiments between the two groups and calculating ALE-difference scores for each permutation.
Real ALE-difference scores (i.e., the ALE values for one group minus the ALE values for the other) are compared against these null distributions to determine voxel-wise significance.
In the original implementation of the algorithm, this procedure is performed separately for a group A > B contrast and a group B > A contrast, where each contrast is limited to voxels that were significant in the first group's original meta-analysis.

In NiMARE, we use an adapted version of the subtraction analysis method in {py:class}`nimare.meta.cbma.ale.ALESubtraction`.
Note that, unlike the original algorithm, the NiMARE implementation analyzes all voxels, rather than only those that show a significant effect of A alone or B alone.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from nimare import meta

kern = meta.kernel.ALEKernel()
sub_meta = meta.cbma.ale.ALESubtraction(kernel_transformer=kern, n_iters=10000)
sub_results = sub_meta.fit(sleuth_dset1, sleuth_dset2)
```

colorbar_ticks = colorbar.get_ticks()
if colorbar_ticks[0] < 0:
    new_ticks = [colorbar_ticks[0], 0, colorbar_ticks[-1]]
else:
    new_ticks = [colorbar_ticks[0], colorbar_ticks[-1]]
colorbar.set_ticks(new_ticks, update_ticks=True)

    pad_inches=0,

Alternatively, MKDA Chi-squared analysis is inherently a subtraction analysis method, in that it compares foci from two groups of studies.
Generally, one of these groups is a sample of interest, while the other is a meta-analytic database (minus the studies in the sample).
With this setup, meta-analysts can infer whether there is greater convergence of foci in a voxel as compared to the baseline across the field (as estimated with the meta-analytic database), much like SCALE.
However, if the database is replaced with a second sample of interest, the analysis ends up comparing convergence between the two groups.
