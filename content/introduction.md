# Introduction

We introduce **NiMARE** (Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment), a Python package for analyzing meta-analytic neuroimaging data.
NiMARE is a new library developed as a component in a burgeoning open-source meta-analytic ecosystem for neuroimaging data, which currently includes Neurosynth, NeuroVault, NeuroQuery, and PyMARE.

While several libraries already exist for neuroimaging meta-analysis, these libraries are generally algorithm-specific, and are provided in a range of very different user interfaces, languages, and licenses.
This variability may prevent meta-analysts from using the most appropriate algorithm for a given analysis.
Further, having multiple meta-analysis algorithms available in one library facilitates direct comparisons of methods.
With NiMARE, we consolidate meta-analytic algorithms from a range of libraries and publications, and provide a common Python syntax and well documented application program interfaces.
Additionally, NiMARE is a collaboratively-developed open source package, enabling researchers to contribute new methods not included in the current version.

In this paper, we describe NiMARE's aims, architecture and the functionality it supportsâ€”including tools for database extraction, automated annotation, meta-analysis, meta-analytic coactivation modeling, and functional decoding.
The text is accompanied by extensive code samples and results (also available online in the form of Python scripts; https://github.com/NBCLab/nimare-paper with additional documentation in https://github.com/neurodatascience/meta_analysis_notebook), ensuring that users can follow along interactively.
