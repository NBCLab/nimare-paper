# Other Meta-analytic Approaches

Meta-analytic databases and algorithms may be employed for derivative analyses, including subtraction analysis, meta-analytic coactivation modeling (MACM), meta-analytic clustering, coactivation-based parcellation (CBP), meta-analytic independent component analysis (meta-ICA), semantic model development, and meta-analytic functional decoding.
Below we describe these derivative analyses and include examples of use cases.
