    "Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) is currently the most popular method for neuroimaging meta-analysis, given that the majority of fMRI papers currently report their findings as peaks of statistically significant clusters in standard space and do not release unthresholded statistical maps. These peaks indicate where significant results were found in the brain, and thus do not reflect an effect size estimate for each hypothesis test (i.e., each voxel) as one would expect for a typical meta-analysis. As such, standard methods for effect size-based meta-analysis cannot be applied. Over the past two decades, a number of algorithms have been developed to determine whether peaks converge across experiments in order to identify locations of consistent or specific activation associated with a given hypothesis \\cite{Samartsidis2017-ej,Muller2018-mt}.\n",

    "Kernel-based methods evaluate convergence of coordinates across studies by first convolving foci with a spatial kernel to produce study-specific modeled activation maps, then combining those modeled activation maps into a sample-wise map, which is compared to a null distribution to evaluate voxel-wise statistical significance. Additionally, for each of the following approaches, except for SCALE, voxel- or cluster-level multiple comparisons correction may be performed using Monte Carlo simulations or false discovery rate (FDR) \\cite{Laird2005-qh} correction. Basic multiple-comparisons correction methods (e.g., Bonferroni correction) are also supported. **Listing 3** displays a sample code snippet illustrating how to create modeled activation maps for a Dataset using a range of kernel types."

    "**Multilevel kernel density analysis** (MKDA) \\cite{Wager2007-jc} is a kernel-based method that convolves each peak from each study with a binary sphere of a set radius. These peak-specific binary maps are then combined into study-specific maps by taking the maximum value for each voxel. Study-specific maps are then averaged across the meta-analytic sample. This averaging is generally weighted by studies’ sample sizes, although other covariates may be included, such as weights based on the type of inference (random or fixed effects) employed in the study’s analysis. An arbitrary threshold is generally employed to zero-out voxels with very low values, and then a Monte Carlo procedure is used to assess statistical significance, either at the voxel or cluster level."

The interface is virtually identical, but since there are few if any legitimate uses of KDA (which models studies as fixed rather than random effects), we do not discuss it further here."

    "**Specific coactivation likelihood estimation** (SCALE) \\cite{Langner2014-ei} is an extension of the ALE algorithm developed for meta-analytic coactivation modeling (MACM) analyses. Rather than comparing convergence of foci within the sample to a null distribution derived under the assumption of spatial randomness within the brain, SCALE assesses whether the convergence at each voxel is greater than in the general literature. Each voxel in the brain is assigned a null distribution determined based on the base rate of activation for that voxel across an existing coordinate-based meta-analytic database. This approach allows for the generation of a statistical map for the sample, but no methods for multiple comparisons correction have yet been developed. While this method was developed to support analysis of joint activation or “coactivation” patterns, it is generic and can be applied to any CBMA; see Other Meta-analytic Approaches below."

    "An alternative to the density-based approaches (i.e., MKDA, KDA, ALE, and SCALE) is the **MKDA Chi-squared** extension \\cite{Wager2007-jc}. Though still a kernel-based method in which foci are convolved with a binary sphere and combined within studies, this approach uses voxel-wise chi-squared tests to assess both consistency (i.e., higher convergence of foci within the meta-analytic sample than expected by chance) and specificity (i.e., higher convergence of foci within the meta-analytic sample than detected in an unrelated dataset) of activation. Such an analysis also requires access to a reference meta-analytic sample or database of studies. For example, to perform a chi-squared analysis of working memory studies, the researcher will also need a comprehensive set of studies which did not manipulate working memory—ideally one that is matched with the working memory study set on all relevant attributes _except_ the involvement of working memory."
