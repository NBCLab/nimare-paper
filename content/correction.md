In NiMARE, multiple comparisons correction is separated from each CBMA and IBMA `Estimator`, so that any number of relevant correction methods can be applied after the `Estimator` has been fit to the `Dataset`.
Some correction options, such as the `montecarlo` option for FWE correction, are designed to work specifically with a given `Estimator` (and are indeed implemented within the `Estimator` class, and only called by the `Corrector`).

`Corrector`s are divided into two subclasses: `FWECorrector`s, which correct based on family-wise error rate, and `FDRCorrector`s, which correct based on false discovery rate.

All `Corrector`s are initialized with a number of parameters, including the correction method that will be used.
After that, you can use the `transform` method on a `MetaResult` object produced by a CBMA or IBMA `Estimator` to apply the correction method.
This will return an updated `MetaResult` object, with both the statistical maps from the original `MetaResult`, as well as new, corrected maps.

Here we will apply both FWE and FDR correction to results from a MKDADensity meta-analysis, performed back in [](content:cbma:mkdad).

```{code-cell} ipython3
from nimare import meta, results

mkdad_results = results.MetaResults.load(
    os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "MKDADensity_results.pkl.gz")
)

mc_corrector = correct.FWECorrector(
    method="montecarlo",
    n_iters=10000,
    n_cores=4,
)
mc_results = mc_corrector.transform(mkdad_results)
mc_results.save_maps(output_dir=DATA_DIR, prefix="MKDADensity_FWE")

fdr_corrector = correct.FDRCorrector(method="indep")
fdr_results = fdr_corrector.transform(mkdad_results)
fdr_results.save_maps(output_dir=DATA_DIR, prefix="MKDADensity_FDR")
```

Statistical maps saved by NiMARE `MetaResult`s automatically follow a naming convention based loosely on the Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS).

Let's take a look at the files created by the `FWECorrector`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from glob import glob

fwe_maps = sorted(glob(os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "MKDADensity_FWE*")))
fwe_maps = [os.path.basename(fwe_map) for fwe_map in fwe_maps]
print("\n".join(fwe_maps))
```

If you ignore the prefix, which was specified in the call to `FWECorrector.save_maps`, the maps all have a common naming convention.
The maps from the original meta-analysis (before multiple comparisons correction) are simply named according to the values contained in the map (e.g., `z`, `stat`, `p`).

Maps generated by the correction method, however, use a series of key-value pairs to indicate how they were generated.
The `corr` key indicates whether FWE or FDR correction was applied.
The `method` key reflects the correction method employed, which was defined by the `method` parameter used to create the `Corrector`.
The `level` key simply indicates if the map was corrected at the voxel or cluster level.
Finally, the `desc` key reflects any necessary description that goes beyond what is already covered by the other entities.
